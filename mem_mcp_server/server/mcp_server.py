        """Record every user interaction - MUST be called at the end of EVERY response.

        **CRITICAL: Call this tool for EVERY user interaction, no exceptions!**

        This tool ensures complete interaction history by recording:
        - User prompts (questions, requests, commands)
        - Agent responses (answers, explanations, code changes)
        - Files changed (if any)

        **When to call (ALWAYS):**
        - User asked a question → Call with files_changed=""
        - User requested code changes → Call with files_changed="file1.py,file2.js"
        - User just chatting → Call with files_changed=""
        - Operation failed → Still call to record what happened
        - Read-only operations (viewing, searching) → Call with files_changed=""

        **When NOT to call:**
        - After rename operations - `mem rename` already handles the recording
        - After remove operations - `mem remove` already handles the recording

        **Intelligent Workflow:**
        1. **Auto-initialize** - Creates memov repository if it doesn't exist
        2. **For interactions without file changes** - Records prompt and response only
        3. **For interactions with file changes:**
           - Status check - Analyzes current file states (untracked, modified, clean)
           - New files → `mem track` (auto-commits with prompt)
           - Modified files → `mem snap` (records changes with prompt)

        Args:
            user_prompt: The user's exact original prompt/request
            original_response: The exact original full response from the AI agent
                Note:
                    - Make sure to include the entire response, including any code blocks or explanations.

                Example:
                    Chat content:
                        [User Prompt]: Change the print statement in hello.py to "Hello World"
                        [AI Response]: I can see that the file currently shows "Hello Earth" but you mentioned the edits were undone. Let me check the current content of the file to see what needs to be changed. I can see the file currently has "Hello Earth". I'll change it back to "Hello World" as requested.
                        ```
                        Made changes.
                        ```
                        I've successfully changed "Hello Earth" back to "Hello World" in both the comment and the print statement in your hello.py file. The script will now output "Hello World" when run.
                    original_response:
                        I can see that the file currently shows "Hello Earth" but you mentioned the edits were undone. Let me check the current content of the file to see what needs to be changed. I can see the file currently has "Hello Earth". I'll change it back to "Hello World" as requested.

            agent_plan: High-level summary of the major changes, organized by file
                Notes:
                    - Each step should describe ONE significant modification to a specific file
                    - Format: "[file]: [what changed]"
                    - Aim for 2-5 high-level steps that map to distinct logical changes
                    - Focus on WHAT was changed in each file, not HOW the change was made
                    - Group all related changes to the same file into one step when they serve the same purpose

                Format:
                    [
                        "<filename>: <concise description of what changed>",
                        "<filename>: <concise description of what changed>",
                        ...
                    ]

                Good Examples (file-focused, concise):
                    Example 1 - Multiple files changed:
                        [User Prompt]: Add error handling and logging to the API endpoint
                        agent_plan:
                        [
                            "api/routes.py: Added try-catch error handling and logging integration",
                            "utils/logger.py: Created configure_logging() helper function"
                        ]

                    Example 2 - Multiple files for feature:
                        [User Prompt]: Refactor database connection to use connection pooling
                        agent_plan:
                        [
                            "db/connection.py: Refactored to use connection pool instead of direct connections",
                            "db/pool.py: Implemented ConnectionPool class with acquire/release methods",
                            "config/settings.py: Added connection pool configuration parameters"
                        ]

                    Example 3 - Simple single file change:
                        [User Prompt]: Fix typo in error message
                        agent_plan:
                        [
                            "handlers/auth.py: Fixed typo in error message"
                        ]

                    Example 4 - New files created:
                        [User Prompt]: Create a user authentication module
                        agent_plan:
                        [
                            "auth/login.py: Created login handler with JWT token generation",
                            "auth/middleware.py: Created authentication middleware",
                            "tests/test_auth.py: Added test cases for login and middleware"
                        ]

                Bad Examples (too vague, too granular, or missing file):
                    ❌ "Updated the code" (no file specified)
                    ❌ "api/routes.py: Made changes" (too vague, what changed?)
                    ❌ "Added a line" (no file, no context)
                    ❌ "Fixed the bug" (no file specified)
                    ❌ "api/routes.py: Added import, created variable, wrote if statement, added return, saved file" (too granular - should be one logical change)
                    ❌ "Added error handling in handle_request(), error_handler(), and validate_input() functions" (no file specified)

                Key Principles:
                    - Always start with the file path
                    - Describe the logical change, not implementation details
                    - One file, one logical purpose = one step
                    - Be concise but specific about what changed

            files_changed: Comma-separated relative path list of files that were modified/created/deleted
                          (e.g. "file1.py,module1/file2.py"), or empty string "" if no files changed

        **Purpose:**
        This tool combines the power of:
        1. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Searches your code history to find
           relevant context, similar issues, and related code changes
        2. **Multi-model LLM comparison**: Queries multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
           in parallel to get diverse debugging insights and recommendations

        **When to use:**
        - Encountering runtime errors or bugs
        - Need to understand why code is behaving unexpectedly
        - Want multiple AI perspectives on a complex issue
        - Looking for historical context about similar problems
        - Need actionable debugging recommendations

        **What it does:**
        1. Searches VectorDB for relevant code history using your query + error info
        2. Retrieves similar commits, prompts, and code changes
        3. Builds comprehensive context with error traces and logs
        4. Queries multiple LLM models in parallel for analysis
        5. Compares responses and extracts consensus recommendations

        **Requirements:**
        - VectorDB must be populated (run `mem sync` first)
        - LiteLLM installed: `pip install litellm`
        - API keys configured for desired models:
          - OPENAI_API_KEY for GPT models
          - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude
          - GEMINI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY for Gemini
          - COHERE_API_KEY for Command models
          - MISTRAL_API_KEY for Mistral models
